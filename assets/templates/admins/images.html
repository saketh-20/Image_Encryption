    <h1>Random Number Generator with<span style="color:#b29b35;"> XorShiftAnd</span> and Image Encryption</h1>
    <blockquote> With the rapid development of computer science, fast and secure transmission of data has gained great
        importance. Undoubtedly, one of the most common data types is digital images. The attractiveness of digital
        images is result of wide range usage from social media to defense industry. In order to transmit through correct
        and secure channels, images must be encrypted before they are sent. The relevant process is realized by means of
        encryption algorithms. Symmetric steams encryption algorithms which have been proposed so far have weaknesses in
        terms of speed and processing power. Therefore, encryption quality drops dramatically in certain scenarios. A
        novel symmetric stream encryption algorithm called XorShiftAnd has been proposed in this study.
